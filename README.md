no errors that can be thrown are included yet.

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'coinswitch'
```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

explore the gem to an overview of the methods.


`
require 'coinswitch'
client = Coinswitch::Dynamic::DynamicClient.new
puts client.orderid('11111111-6c9e-4c53-9a6d-55e089aebd04')`

this will use ipify to fetch your external ip and use the development sandbox credentials to make queries.
the resultant requests are passed through JSON.parse to create a ruby dict. Currently their is no error handling or errors.
the queries themselves are just httparty requests. simple to modify.

the current initialize for the DynamicClient Class looks like this:
`def initialize(ip_address=Ipify.ip,api_key=Coinswitch::SANDBOX_API_KEY)`
so dead simple. the methods are named after the endpoints which are described here:
https://developer.coinswitch.co/reference#instant-exchange-api with the exception of
`puts client.coins_list` which is a convenience feature i added. it returns an array of coins that can be traded.

right now this simple library just does the job and pull requests are welcomed.

its just a wrapper round httparty requests.
